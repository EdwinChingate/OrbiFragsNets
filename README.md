# AutomaticAnnotation
This software defines features in an MS2 file, and finds the chemical structures that fit the confidence interval for each fragment. It also finds the chemical structures that fit the difference in between two fragments, and if the mass differences can be explain for atomic difference (number of atoms) in between the two fragments, it's an edge for a network of fragments. Then the network with the highest grade is selected for annotation.
